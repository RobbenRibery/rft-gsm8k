        User:
        What's the price of 2 eggs, one is $1.50, and the other is $1.00?

        Let's break down the problem step by step:
        1. We have two eggs, one is $1.50, and the other is $1.00.
        2. The total price of 2 eggs is $1.50 + $1.00 = << 1.50 + 1.00 = 2.50 >> $2.50
        Answer: #### 2.50 <<{eos_token}>>

        **Formulas
        Make sure to perform any calculations with PURE DIGITS in side "<< >>" tags, and quote the result outside the tag once complete.
        i.e. 1 (egg) + 1 (egg) = <<1 + 1 = 2>> 2 eggs. Noticed that formula inside the << >> tags does not contain units.
